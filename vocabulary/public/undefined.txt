In the United Kingdom, we have recently started a project to compile a
British National Corpus (BNC): a computer corpus of 100 million words of
British English, written and spoken. My purpose here is to describe the design, compilation, and foreseen uses of this corpus. I hope this will be of interest to this present audience, since other countries, perhaps especially
Korea, may learn from our experience of building a national corpus of the
native language. Lessons can, of course, be learned not only from the successes, but from shortcomings of our work.
The British National Corpus (BNC) project is a collaboration between
commercial and academic partners. The leading partner is Oxford University Press, and two other major publishers (Longaman Group Ltd and Chambers) are also contributing on the commercial side. On the academic side,
the collaborators are the Oxford University Computing Service, and Lancaster University. The British Library (our national library) also takes a
role in such areas as archiving the corpus material and making it available.
The project is supported approximately 50 percent by the British Goverment (Department of Trade and Industry, and Science and Engineering
Research Council). It began in January 1991 and will continue for three
years. The corpus is intended to be representative of a very broad range of
English language use in speech and writing.
